The figs directory is organized as follows:

./src/

   This directory holds SVG source files. They can be created or
   edited with any vector graphics editor (e.g. InkScape, Google
   Drawings, etc). Since SVG graphics are vectorized, they can scale
   to any size. But first they need to be converted to PDFs so LaTeX
   can read them.

./pre/

   This directory holds pre-rendered raster files (png, jpg, etc).
   These can be included directly in the LaTeX.

./out/

   This directory holds rendered PDF versions of the files in the
   ./src/ directory. To generate PDF figs, run 'make figs' from the
   repo's top level directory. InkScape must be installed for this
   command to work.
